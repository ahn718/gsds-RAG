3,"A man and a woman have 2 children, both of whom are affected by an autosomal recessive condition. The woman is pregnant; what is the chance that their next child will be a boy with this condition (barring any unusual scenarios or exceptions)?
0.025%
12.5%
25%
33%","Answer: 25% Reason:  The gene in question is an autosomal recessive gene, meaning that the individual must inherit two copies of the gene (one from each parent) in order to develop the condition. Since both children are affected, it is likely that each parent is a carrier of the gene, meaning they each have one copy of the gene. Since the gene is autosomal, the chance of passing on the gene to the next child is 50%, or 25%. Therefore, the chance that the next child will be a boy with the condition is 25%.","Answer: 25% Reason: The gene has a maternal inheritance pattern. Since both children are affected, the mother is a carrier of the condition. When the mother is pregnant again, the probability of the next child being a boy with the condition is 25%.",12.50%

18,"Prenatal ultrasound shows findings consistent with Thanataphoric dysplasia; molecular testing via amniocentesis confirms the diagnosis. No parental testing has been done yet. What is the most likely recurrence risk?
<1%
25%
33%
50%","Answer: 25% Reason: Thanataphoric dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the KCNQ1OT1 gene. The gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 and plays a crucial role in regulating the development and function of the nervous system. Prenatal ultrasound findings consistent with Thanataphoric dysplasia are typically seen in the first trimester of pregnancy, typically between 12 and 14 weeks of age. These findings include abnormalities in brain and spinal cord, such as a thin or absent (hydrocephalus), thin or absent cerebellum, and thin or absent pons. Molecular testing via amniocentesis confirms the diagnosis by detecting the mutation in the KCNQ1OT1 gene. The recurrence risk for Thanataphoric dysplasia is estimated to be around 25%, which means that if one parent is a carrier, there is a 25% chance that each offspring will inherit the mutation and develop the disorder. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on limited data and more research is needed to accurately determine the recurrence risk for this rare genetic disorder.","Answer: 50% Reason:  Thanataphoric dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DM20 gene. Since this gene is located on the X chromosome, it is more likely that a male carrier will be affected than a female carrier. Since the prenatal ultrasound findings are consistent with Thanataphoric dysplasia, it is likely that the affected gene is the X-linked DM20 gene. According to the literature, the recurrence risk for Thanataphoric dysplasia is 50% in males and 0% in females. Therefore, the most likely recurrence risk for this family is 50%.",<1%
19,"A patient is suspected to have mosaicism for a specific genetic variant (a rare single nucleotide variant). Which of the following assays would likely provide the most precise information about the level of mosaicism for this variant?
Digital droplet PCR
Genome sequencing
SNP microarray
NGS-based panel testing","Answer: Genome sequencing Reason: Genome sequencing is the most likely to provide the most precise information about the level of mosaicism for a specific genetic variant. This is because genome sequencing can detect all variants, including rare single nucleotide variants, in the patient's DNA, regardless of their frequency or distribution. Digital droplet PCR and SNP microarray are limited to detecting more common variants, and may not be as effective at detecting rare variants. NGS-based panel testing may also be able to detect rare variants, but the accuracy of the results may be affected by the panel size and the number of samples.",Answer: Genome sequencing.,Digital droplet PCR

The couple, both of whom are healthy, are from a community where a childhood-onset autosomal recessive genetic condition affects about 1 in 100 people. The man¡¯s brother has the condition. What is the approximate chance that the couple¡¯s child will be affected?
0.1%
1%
3%
6%","Answer: 3% Reason: The gene in question is KCNQ1OT1. It is a maternally expressed imprinted gene, which means that only the copy of the gene that comes from the mother is active. The copy that comes from the father is turned off (silenced). Since the gene is imprinted, the activity of the gene depends on the parent of origin. As the gene is inherited from the father, the paternal copy is turned off (silenced). So, the chance that the couple's child will be affected is 3%.","Answer: 3% Reason: The couple's child has a 3% chance of being affected with the autosomal recessive genetic condition, based on the information provided.",3%
25,"A patient with neonatal-onset epilepsy has been found to have bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the gene ALDH7A1. What treatment might be effective based on the genetic information?
Allopurinol
Colchicine
Levodopa
Pyridoxine","Colchicine Reason:  The ALDH7A1 gene is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain.  Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the ALDH7A1 gene have been associated with neonatal-onset epilepsy.  Colchicine is a drug that inhibits the activity of enzymes involved in the breakdown of lysine.  By inhibiting the breakdown of lysine, colchicine may be effective in treating epilepsy caused by variants in the ALDH7A1 gene.","Answer: Colchicine Reason: The ALDH7A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin, which is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino) lysine in the brain.  Since colchicine is known to inhibit the activity of the enzyme, it may be an effective treatment for the patient's neonatal-onset epilepsy.",Pyridoxine

i(1q)
i(18p)
i(Xq)
i(Yp)","Answer: (1q) Reason: The most common isochromosome in humans is (1q), also known as the long arm of chromosome 1. This is because (1q) is the most frequently observed isochromosome in the general population, and is found in approximately 70% of individuals. (1q) is a result of a non-disjunction event during meiosis, which led to the creation of an extra copy of the short arm of chromosome 1. This extra copy is then inherited as a single isochromosome in all of the individual's cells.","Answer: (18p) Reason: The (18p) is the most common isochromosome in humans. This is because the (18p) is a part of a sex chromosome, specifically the Y chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes in humans. The (18p) is present in almost all of the cells in the human body, and is responsible for the sex determination of an individual. The (18p) is present in both males and females, but in different amounts. In males, the (18p) is present in a higher amount than in females, which is why males have a higher risk of developing certain diseases such as testicular cancer.",i(Xq)

45,"A man and a woman both have a clinical condition because they both have a certain heterozygous genetic variant. They have a child, who inherits both genetic changes (one from each parent). The child is much more severely affected than the parents. What is the term for this inheritance?

Codominance
Incomplete dominance
Variable expressivity
X-linked inheritance","Answer: X-linked inheritance Reason: The inheritance pattern observed in this scenario is X-linked inheritance, where the child inherits both the paternal and maternal alleles of the gene, resulting in a more severe expression of the clinical condition compared to the parents. X-linked inheritance is a mode of inheritance in which the genetic effect of one X-chromosome is masked or modified by the presence of another X-chromosome with a different genotype.",Answer: Incomplete dominance.,Incomplete dominance
46,"A person has a very rare genetic condition that affects about 1 in 500,000 people. A test to detect this condition has 95% sensitivity and 99% specificity. What is the chance that the test will be negative for this individual?

1%
5%
95%
99%","Answer: 95% Reason: The test has 95% sensitivity, which means that for every 100 individuals tested, the test will correctly identify 95 individuals with the condition as present, and 5 individuals as not having the condition as present. In this case, the individual has the condition, so the probability of a negative test result is 5% (5/100).","Answer: 5%. Reason: The test has 95% sensitivity, which means that for every 100 individuals tested, 95 will actually have the condition. Since the individual has the condition, they are not included in the 95% that will test positive, so the test result will be negative.",5%
47,"A person undergoes enzymatic testing for beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A, related to Tay-Sachs disease). The result shows absent enzyme activity. However, the person is not affected, and does not carry a disease-associated allele. What is the best explanation for this?

49,"You order a microarray for a child with a neurobehavorial phenotype involving autism and developmental delay; he has no other apparent pertinent clinical findings. Which of the following deletions would most likely be expected on the microarray result given the description?

16p11.2
17q11.2
7q11.23
8q23.3-q24.11","Answer: 16p11.2 Reason: The 16p11.2 region is known to be a critical region for neurobehavioral development, and several genes in this region have been implicated in autism and developmental delay. The most common deletions in this region are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and intellectual disability. The 16p11.2 region is also a common target for genomic imprinting, which may also contribute to the clinical presentation.","Answer: 16p11.2 Reason: The 16p11.2 region is known to be imprinted, and the deletion of this region has been associated with neurobehavioral phenotypes, including autism and developmental delay. The child's neurobehavioral phenotype without other apparent pertinent clinical findings suggests that the imprinted 16p11.2 region is the most likely candidate for deletion.",16p11.2
50,"A woman has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Which of the following findings would most suggest that this could be related to a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2?

51,"A person undergoes exome sequencing. Two different pathogenic variants are detected in a gene associated with an autosomal recessive condition. Which of the following would likely best determine the variants¡¯ inheritance (to see if the variants are in cis or trans)?
 
Genome sequencing
Karyotype
Microarray testing
Parental testing","Answer: Karyotype Reason: A karyotype analysis can determine the inheritance pattern of the variants because it provides information about the parental origin of the chromosomes. By analyzing the number of methylation marks on the parental origin of the chromosomes, the inheritance pattern of the variants can be determined. For example, if the variants are only present on the maternally inherited chromosomes, it suggests that the variants are in cis. On the other hand, if the variants are present on both paternal and maternal chromosomes, it suggests that the variants are in trans.",Answer: Microarray testing Reason: ,Parental testing
52,"Based on clinical history and previous testing, you suspect that a patient has ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. What biochemical test might help confirm this diagnosis?

12.5%
25%
50%
100%","Answer: 25% Reason: The gene in question is an imprinted gene. In an imprinted gene, the expression of the gene is influenced by the parental origin of the gene. In this case, the gene is expressed from the father's copy. Since the man is affected with an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic condition, the gene is expressed from the mother's copy, making the man's grandchild a carrier of the condition.","Answer: 50% Reason: The FMR1 gene is functionally modified in the affected individual. The AGG repeats are interrupted by CGG, which stabilizes the long repeated segment. Since the affected individual is a carrier of the condition, there is a 50% chance that the grandchild will be a carrier of the condition.",50%
54,"You suspect that your patient has myotonic dystrophy. Which of the following would suggest that this person has myotonic dystrophy type 1 (versus myotonic dystrophy type 2)?

Arrhythmias 
Cataracts
Developmental delay
Myotonia","Reason: Myotonia is a key feature of myotonic dystrophy, particularly myotonic dystrophy type 1. Myotonia is a condition characterized by muscle stiffness or rigidity, particularly in the face, neck, and hands. It is a result of a abnormality in the DMPK gene, which provides instructions for making the protein myotonic dystrophy protein kinase. This protein is involved in communication inside cells and between cells, particularly in muscle cells. In myotonic dystrophy, the abnormality in the DMPK gene leads to an imbalance in the protein's function, which causes the muscle stiffness or rigidity. Myotonia is typically the first symptom to appear in people with myotonic dystrophy, particularly those with myotonic dystrophy type 1.",Answer: The triplet repeat number (54) suggests that the individual has myotonic dystrophy type 1.,Developmental delay
55,"You follow a young adult who has been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. Her father is also affected; he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in his late 30s. According to current guidelines, at about what age is colonoscopy recommended for your patient?

56,"A young adult has anomalies affecting the limbs, but extensive testing, exam, and history do not reveal any other medical issues, such as affecting other organ systems, or neurodevelopmental issues. What gene would most likely be involved?

BBS1
FANCA
GDF5
NIPBL","Answer: GDF5 Reason: The gene GDF5 is most likely involved in this case because it has been shown to be responsible for a rare genetic disorder known as ""limb reductionism,"" which results in shortened limbs. This disorder is caused by mutations in the GDF5 gene, and it is the only gene among the options provided that is known to cause this specific type of limb abnormality.","Answer: GDF5 Reason:  The young adult's anomalies affecting the limbs are consistent with a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GDF5 gene. The GDF5 gene is a known imprinted gene, meaning that only the paternally inherited copy is active. Mutations in the paternally inherited copy of the GDF5 gene can cause limb abnormalities, including short stature, brachydactyly (shortened or deformed fingers/toes), and other skeletal abnormalities.",GDF5
57,"You are designing a laboratory assay to test for a condition that involves a ¡°repeat expansion¡± (related to a repeat disorder, like Fragile X syndrome, Huntington disease, or Myotonic dystrophy type 1). Which of the following lab techniques would most likely describe the main test methodology that would be used for this assay?

FISH testing
PCR fragment analysis
Sanger sequencing
SNP-based microarray","Answer: Sanger sequencing Reason: Sanger sequencing is the most likely method used for this assay because it provides the highest resolution and accuracy for detecting repeat expansions, especially for larger repeats. FISH and PCR fragment analysis are less sensitive for detecting repeat expansions, especially for smaller repeats. Sanger sequencing allows for the detection of the exact number of repeats, which is important for diagnosing repeat disorders.",Answer: Sanger sequencing.,PCR fragment analysis
58,"A woman undergoes standard non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) to assess for certain genetic conditions affecting the fetus. What incidental finding would be most likely to be identified (and potentially reported) via this test?

AMP v. Myriad
Diamond v. Chakrabarty
LabCorp v. Metabolite
Mayo v. Prometheus","Answer: AMP v. Myriad Reason: The Supreme Court case of AMP v. Myriad (2013) most directly led to the current stance that human genes cannot be patented. In this case, the court held that genes are not patent eligible because they are ""products of nature"" and not ""human inventions."" This decision effectively overturned previous decisions that had allowed the patenting of genes, and established a new legal framework for determining what can and cannot be patented in the field of genetics.","Answer: AMP v. Myriad Reason: In 2013, the United States Supreme Court case AMP v. Myriad (2013) directly led to the current stance that human genes cannot be patented. In this case, the Supreme Court held that genes are not patentable because they are ""products of nature"" and not ""human inventions."" This decision overturned a previous ruling that had allowed Myriad to patent the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The Supreme Court's ruling in AMP v. Myriad has had significant implications for the field of genetics and has led to a reevaluation of the patentability of human genes.",AMP v. Myriad
60,"A patient is suspected to have a genetic cause of rhabdomyolysis. A condition affecting which pathway or mechanism would be most likely?

Bile acid synthesis
Fatty acid oxidation
Peroxisomal metabolism
Urea cycle","Answer: The answer is: Bile acid synthesis. Reason: Rhabdomyolysis is a condition where muscle tissue is damaged, leading to release of glycogen and other cellular components into the blood. Bile acid synthesis is a metabolic pathway that is not directly related to muscle tissue, so it is less likely to be affected in a patient with rhabdomyolysis.",Answer: Urea cycle,Fatty acid oxidation
61,"In a person with sickle cell disease, which treatment would be instituted to help reduce vaso-occlusive sequelae, including pain episodes and acute chest syndrome?

Hydroxyurea
Penicillin
Pneumococcal vaccine
TNF inhibitors","Reason: Penicillin is not a treatment for sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea, TNF inhibitors, and Pneumococcal vaccine are treatments for sickle cell disease that can help reduce vaso-occlusive sequelae, including pain episodes and acute chest syndrome. Penicillin is an antibiotic that is not effective in treating sickle cell disease.","Answer: Hydroxyurea Reason: Hydroxyurea is a standard treatment for sickle cell disease, particularly for vaso-occlusive sequelae, including pain episodes and acute chest syndrome. Hydroxyurea works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin, which reduces the severity of sickling and improves the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Studies have shown that hydroxyurea significantly reduces the frequency and severity of pain episodes and acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease.",Hydroxyurea
62,"A couple has several children who appear to be affected by a genetic condition. Cytogenetic testing via peripheral blood reveals a cause in one of the parents, both of whom are healthy. Which of the following is the most likely finding in the parent?

Monosomy
Paracentric inversion
Pericentric inversion
Trisomy",Answer: Paracentric inversion.,"Answer: Trisomy. Reason:  Trisomy occurs when a person inherits three copies of a gene instead of the usual two copies. This can happen if the sperm or egg cell that fertilizes the parent cell has an extra copy of the gene. Since both parents are healthy, the extra copy of the gene must be inherited from one of them. In this case, the most likely finding in the parent is trisomy of the gene.",Pericentric inversion
63,"A person has a suspected genetic condition, but exome testing does not identify the cause. Subsequent genome sequencing does identify the cause, however. Based on this, what type of variant was most likely identified by genome sequencing?

Deep intronic variant
Exonic variant
Mosaic variant
Multi-gene deletion","Answer: Exonic variant Reason: Exome testing typically focuses on the protein-coding regions of the genes (exons), while genome sequencing covers the entire genome, including non-coding regions (introns) and intergenic regions. The identification of the cause of the genetic condition by genome sequencing suggests that the variant identified is likely to be an exonic variant, which is a change in the DNA sequence of an exon, the regions of a gene that contain the information needed to produce a protein.",Answer: Exonic variant.,Deep intronic variant
64,"The mitochondrial genome contains multiple genes. Other than genes for tRNAs and rRNAs, mitochondrial genes encode subunits involved in what biological process?

Bardet-Biedl syndrome
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
Fragile X syndrome
Prader-Willi syndrome",Answer: Fragile X syndrome,"Fragile X syndrome Reason:  Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that can be molecularly confirmed through exome sequencing. It is caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene, which leads to a toxic RNA product that disrupts the functioning of the nerves, testes, or ovaries. Exome sequencing can identify the number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene, which can help diagnose Fragile X syndrome.",Bardet-Biedl syndrome
68,"A man has bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene, but does not have clinical signs of cystic fibrosis. He may have congenital absence of which of the following?

Neutrophils
Pancreas
Thymus
Vas deferens",Answer: Pancreas.,"Answer: Pancreas. Reason: The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein functions as a channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The channel transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells. The transport of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus. Mucin is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. The CFTR protein also regulates the function of other channels, such as those that transport positively charged particles called sodium ions across cell membranes. These channels are necessary for the normal function of organs such as the lungs and pancreas. Therefore, a congenital absence of the pancreas would result in a lack of functional CFTR protein, leading to the clinical signs of cystic fibrosis.",Vas deferens

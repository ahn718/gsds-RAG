Both proteins are involved in the immune system. They control pathways in cells that help fight foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The STAT3 protein, in particular, transmits signals for the maturation of immune system cells, especially T cells and B cells. STAT3 is also involved in normal development and maintenance of bones and other tissues.Researchers suspect that the ZNF341 protein controls the activity of other genes, although they have not been identified.')], k=3), VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'HuggingFaceEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x7f052e4c9d90>)], weights=[0.7, 0.3])\n",
